# 🚀 DevOps Playground 🛠️

Welcome to **DevOps Playground**! This is my collection of DevOps tools, scripts, and random configs – aka everything I need to pretend I know what I’m doing. If you’re here, feel free to explore, steal ideas, or laugh at my comments. **Warning**: This isn’t a “Best Practices” repo; it’s more like “Works-for-Me Practices.” 😄

## What's Inside? 📂

Here’s a quick tour of the chaos you’ll find here:

### 🐳 Docker Stuff
- **Dockerfiles**: Custom Dockerfiles for different apps and scenarios. Who needs a VM when you’ve got containers?
- **Docker Commands**: A personal cheat sheet of Docker commands I use (or forget) regularly.

### 🐧 Linux Magic
- **Linux Commands**: All the shell wizardry I’ve managed to collect. From `ls` to slightly more complex stuff. Maybe some accidental `rm -rf` too. 👀

### 🛠️ CI/CD Playground
- **GitHub Actions**: Example workflows to make GitHub do my bidding. Mainly CI/CD pipelines and automation.
- **GitLab CI**: GitLab CI setups for, you know, when I’m feeling fancy and want pipelines over there instead.

### 📝 Ansible Adventures
- **Ansible Playbooks**: Playbooks that help me avoid SSH-ing into servers manually. Automation = happiness.

### 🌐 NGINX Nonsense
- **NGINX Configs**: Because what’s DevOps without setting up a web server or a reverse proxy?

### 📊 Monitoring Mayhem
- **Grafana & Friends**: Dashboards and setups for keeping an eye on things. Mostly Grafana, but maybe other tools I’m playing with too.

## How to Use This Mess

If you’re looking for something specific, check out the folders above. Each has (hopefully) helpful comments, and you’ll probably find at least a few working examples in there. Or just randomly poke around – who doesn’t love a little adventure?
